# Authorization

For this moment, all Kick's public APIs requires authorization (except of authorization endpoints itself) and uses
OAuth 2.1 for this purpose, so you must go through the authorization flow first to get access token.

## Application Setup

Before you begin authorization, you need to set up Kick application to obtain the client ID and secret, redirect
URI, and other credentials and settings. To do this, refer to the Kick's application setup [guide](https://docs.kick.com/getting-started/kick-apps-setup).
